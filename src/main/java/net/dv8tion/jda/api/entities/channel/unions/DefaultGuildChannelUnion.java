 * A specialized union representing all channel types that can be used for the "default" channel for

 * when accepting an invite that is not directed at a specific {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.channel.attribute.IInviteContainer channel}.
 *
 * <br>This class extends {@link StandardGuildChannel} and primarily acts as a discovery tool for
 * developers to understand which channels might be returned as default channels.
 *
 * <p><b>Not all {@link StandardGuildChannel} channels can be used as a default channel!</b>

 * <p>This interface represents the follow concrete channel types:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link TextChannel}</li>
