/**
 * Provides various channel cache getters for Guild channels.
 *
 *
 * These getters only check the caches with the relevant scoping of the implementing type.
 * For example, [Guild] returns channels that exist within the guild,
 * whereas [JDA] or [ShardManager] returns any channels that exist within the shard.
 *
 * <br></br>If this is called on [JDA] or [ShardManager], this may return null immediately after building, because the cache isn't initialized yet.
 * To make sure the cache is initialized after building your [JDA] instance, you can use [JDA.awaitReady].
 *
 *
 * For the most efficient usage, it is recommended to use [CacheView] getters such as [.getTextChannelCache].
 * List getters usually require making a snapshot copy of the underlying cache view, which may introduce an undesirable performance hit.
