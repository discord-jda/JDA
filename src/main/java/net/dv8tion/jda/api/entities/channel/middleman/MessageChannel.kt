/**
 * Represents a Discord channel that can have [Messages][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Message] and files sent to it.
 *
 *
 * **Formattable**<br></br>
 * This interface extends [Formattable][java.util.Formattable] and can be used with a [Formatter][java.util.Formatter]
 * such as used by [String.format(String, Object...)][String.format]
 * or [PrintStream.printf(String, Object...)][java.io.PrintStream.printf].
 *
 *
 * This will use [.getName] rather than [Object.toString]!
 * <br></br>Supported Features:
 *
 *  * **Alternative**
 * <br></br>   - Prepends the name with `#`
 * (Example: `%#s` - results in `#[.getName]`)
 *
 *  * **Width/Left-Justification**
 * <br></br>   - Ensures the size of a format
 * (Example: `%20s` - uses at minimum 20 chars;
 * `%-10s` - uses left-justified padding)
 *
 *  * **Precision**
 * <br></br>   - Cuts the content to the specified size
 * (Example: `%.20s`)
 *
 *
 *
 * More information on formatting syntax can be found in the [format syntax documentation][java.util.Formatter]!
 * <br></br>**[GuildMessageChannel] is a special case which uses [IMentionable.getAsMention()][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.IMentionable.getAsMention]
 * by default and uses the `#[.getName]` format as <u>alternative</u>**

     * <br></br>The request was attempted after the account lost access to the [Guild][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild]
     * typically due to being kicked or removed, or after [Permission.VIEW_CHANNEL][net.dv8tion.jda.api.Permission.VIEW_CHANNEL]
     * was revoked in the [GuildMessageChannel]

     *  * [UNKNOWN_MESSAGE][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.ErrorResponse.UNKNOWN_MESSAGE]
     * <br></br>The provided `messageId` is unknown in this MessageChannel, either due to the id being invalid, or
     * the message it referred to has already been deleted. This might also be triggered for ephemeral messages.

     * **Resource Handling Note:** Once the request is handed off to the requester, for example when you call [RestAction.queue],
     * the requester will automatically clean up all opened files by itself. You are only responsible to close them yourself if it is never handed off properly.
     * For instance, if an exception occurs after using [FileUpload.fromData], before calling [RestAction.queue].
     * You can safely use a try-with-resources to handle this, since [FileUpload.close] becomes ineffective once the request is handed off.
     *
     * @param  messageId
     * The message id. For interactions this supports `"@original"` to edit the source message of the interaction.
     * @param  attachments
     * The new attachments of the message (Can be [FileUploads][FileUpload] or [AttachmentUpdates][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.AttachmentUpdate])
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
