/**
 * Provides various channel cache getters for Guild channels.
 *
 * <p>These getters only check the caches with the relevant scoping of the implementing type.
 * For example, {@link Guild} returns channels that exist within the guild,
 * whereas {@link JDA} or {@link ShardManager} returns any channels that exist within the shard.
 *
 * <br>If this is called on {@link JDA} or {@link ShardManager}, this may return null immediately after building, because the cache isn't initialized yet.
 * To make sure the cache is initialized after building your {@link JDA} instance, you can use {@link JDA#awaitReady()}.
 *
 * <p>For the most efficient usage, it is recommended to use {@link CacheView} getters such as {@link #getTextChannelCache()}.
 * List getters usually require making a snapshot copy of the underlying cache view, which may introduce an undesirable performance hit.
