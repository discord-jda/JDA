/**
 * This utility class can be used to access nested values within [DataObjects][DataObject] and [DataArrays][DataArray].
 *
 *
 * **Path Expression Grammar**<br></br>
 *
 * The syntax for paths is given by this grammar:
 *
 * <pre>`<name-syntax>  ::= /[^.\[\]]+/;
 * <index-syntax> ::= "[" <number> "]";
 * <name>         ::= <name-syntax> | <name-syntax> "?";
 * <index>        ::= <index-syntax> | <index-syntax> "?";
 * <element>      ::= <name> ( <index> )*;
 * <path-start>   ::= <element> | <index> ( <index> )*;
 * <path>         ::= <path-start> ( "." <element> )*;
`</pre> *
 *
 *
 * **Examples**<br></br>
 * Given a JSON object such as:
 * <pre>`{
 * "array": [{
 * "foo": "bar",
 * }]
 * }
`</pre> *
 *
 * The content of `"foo"` can be accessed using the code:
 * <pre>`String foo = DataPath.getString(root, "array[0].foo")`</pre>
 *
 *
 * With the safe-access operator `"?"`, you can also allow missing values within your path:
 * <pre>`String foo = DataPath.getString(root, "array[1]?.foo", "default")`</pre>
 * This will result in `foo == "default"`, since the array element 1 is marked as optional, and missing in the actual object.
