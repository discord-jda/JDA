/**
 * An implementation of a Least-Recently-Used cache.
 * <br></br>When the cache capacity exceeds the configured maximum, the eldest cache entry is evicted.
 *
 *
 * You can use [.unloadUnless], to configure a conditional unloading.
 * If the configured sub-policy evaluates to `true`, the member will not be unloaded even when it is an old cache entry.
 *
 *
 * This is implemented using a queue and counter algorithm, to achieve amortized O(1) performance.
 *
 *
 * **Example**<br></br>
 * <pre>`MemberCachePolicy.ONLINE.and( // only cache online members
 * MemberCachePolicy.lru(1000) // of those online members, track the 1000 most active members
 * .unloadUnless(MemberCachePolicy.VOICE) // always keep voice members cached regardless of age
 * )
`</pre> *
 *
 * This policy would add online members into the pool of cached members.
 * The cached members are limited to 1000 active members, which are handled by the LRU policy.
 * When the LRU cache exceeds the maximum, it will evict the least recently active member from cache.
 * If the sub-policy, in this case [MemberCachePolicy.VOICE], evaluates to `true`, the member is retained in cache.
 * Otherwise, the member is unloaded using [Guild.unloadMember].
 *
 *
 * Note that the LRU policy itself always returns `true` for [.cacheMember], since that makes the member the **most recently used** instead.
 *
 * @see MemberCachePolicy.lru
