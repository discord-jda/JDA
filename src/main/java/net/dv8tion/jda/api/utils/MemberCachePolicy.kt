/**
 * Policy which decides whether a member (and respective user) should be kept in cache.
 * <br>This will be called throughout JDA when a member gets constructed or modified and allows for a dynamically
 * adjusting cache of users.
 *
 * <p>When {@link Guild#pruneMemberCache()} is called, the configured policy will be used to unload any members that the policy
 * has decided not to cache.
 *
 * <p>If {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_MEMBERS GUILD_MEMBERS} intent is disabled you should not use {@link #ALL} or {@link #ONLINE}.
 * This intent enables guild member leave events which are required to remove members from cache properly.
 *
 * <p>This can be configured with {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#setMemberCachePolicy(MemberCachePolicy) JDABuilder.setMemberCachePolicy(MemberCachePolicy)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Example Policy</b><br>
 * <pre>{@code
 * MemberCachePolicy.VOICE                         // Keep in cache if currently in voice (skip LRU and ONLINE)
 *     .or(MemberCachePolicy.ONLINE)               // Otherwise, only add to cache if online
 *     .and(MemberCachePolicy.lru(1000)            // keep 1000 recently active members
 *         .unloadUnless(MemberCachePolicy.VOICE)) // only unload if they are not in voice/guild owner
