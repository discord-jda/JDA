/**
 * Policy which decides whether a member (and respective user) should be kept in cache.
 * <br></br>This will be called throughout JDA when a member gets constructed or modified and allows for a dynamically
 * adjusting cache of users.
 *
 *
 * When [Guild.pruneMemberCache] is called, the configured policy will be used to unload any members that the policy
 * has decided not to cache.
 *
 *
 * If [GUILD_MEMBERS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS] intent is disabled you should not use [.ALL] or [.ONLINE].
 * This intent enables guild member leave events which are required to remove members from cache properly.
 *
 *
 * This can be configured with [JDABuilder.setMemberCachePolicy(MemberCachePolicy)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.setMemberCachePolicy].
 *
 *
 * **Example Policy**<br></br>
 * <pre>`MemberCachePolicy.VOICE                         // Keep in cache if currently in voice (skip LRU and ONLINE)
 * .or(MemberCachePolicy.ONLINE)               // Otherwise, only add to cache if online
 * .and(MemberCachePolicy.lru(1000)            // keep 1000 recently active members
 * .unloadUnless(MemberCachePolicy.VOICE)) // only unload if they are not in voice/guild owner
