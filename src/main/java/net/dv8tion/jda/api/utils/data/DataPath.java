/**
 * This utility class can be used to access nested values within {@link DataObject DataObjects} and {@link DataArray DataArrays}.
 *
 * <p><b>Path Expression Grammar</b><br>
 *
 * The syntax for paths is given by this grammar:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * <name-syntax>  ::= /[^.\[\]]+/;
 * <index-syntax> ::= "[" <number> "]";
 * <name>         ::= <name-syntax> | <name-syntax> "?";
 * <index>        ::= <index-syntax> | <index-syntax> "?";
 * <element>      ::= <name> ( <index> )*;
 * <path-start>   ::= <element> | <index> ( <index> )*;
 * <path>         ::= <path-start> ( "." <element> )*;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Examples</b><br>
 * Given a JSON object such as:
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *     "array": [{
 *         "foo": "bar",
 *     }]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The content of {@code "foo"} can be accessed using the code:
 * <pre>{@code String foo = DataPath.getString(root, "array[0].foo")}</pre>
 *
 * <p>With the safe-access operator {@code "?"}, you can also allow missing values within your path:
 * <pre>{@code String foo = DataPath.getString(root, "array[1]?.foo", "default")}</pre>
 * This will result in {@code foo == "default"}, since the array element 1 is marked as optional, and missing in the actual object.
