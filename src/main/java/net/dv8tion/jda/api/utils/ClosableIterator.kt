/**
 * Iterator holding a resource that must be free'd by the consumer.
 * <br></br>Close is an idempotent function and can be performed multiple times without effects beyond first invocation.
 *
 *
 * This closes automatically when [.hasNext] returns `false` but
 * its recommended to only be used within a `try-with-resources` block for safety.
 *
 *
 * **Example**<br></br>
 * This can handle any exceptions thrown while iterating and ensures the lock is released correctly.
 * <pre>`try (ClosableIterator<T> it = cacheView.lockedIterator()) {
 * while (it.hasNext()) {
 * consume(it.next());
 * }
 * }
