/**
 * TargetType for an [ActionType][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.ActionType]
 * <br></br>This describes what kind of Discord entity is being targeted by an auditable action!
 *
 *
 * This can be found via [ActionType.getTargetType()][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.ActionType.getTargetType]
 * or [AuditLogEntry.getTargetType()][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.AuditLogEntry.getTargetType].
 * <br></br>This helps to decide what entity type the target id of an AuditLogEntry refers to.
 *
 *
 * **Example**<br></br>
 * If `entry.getTargetType()` is type [.GUILD]
 * <br></br>Then the target id returned by `entry.getTargetId()` and `entry.getTargetIdLong()`
 * can be used with [JDA.getGuildById(id)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDA.getGuildById]
