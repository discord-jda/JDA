/**
 * Thread-Local audit-log reason used automatically by [AuditableRestAction][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.restaction.AuditableRestAction] instances
 * when no other reason was set.
 *
 *
 * Note that [RestAction.queue()][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.RestAction.queue] will forward any
 * thread-local reason set through this handle. Thus audit-log reasons done by callbacks will also use the one set
 * from the executing thread.
 *
 *
 * **Example without closable**<br></br>
 * <pre>`
 * String previousReason = ThreadLocalReason.getCurrent();
 * ThreadLocalReason.setCurrent("Hello World");
 * try {
 * guild.ban(user, 0).queue(v -> {
 * guild.unban(user).queue(); // also uses the reason "Hello World"
 * });
 * } finally {
 * //Forwarding the reason is not async so resetting it here is fine.
 * ThreadLocalReason.setCurrent(previousReason);
 * }
 * //This will not use the reason "Hello World" but the previous, or none if none was set previously
 * guild.kick(user).queue();
`</pre> *
 *
 *
 * **Example with closable**<br></br>
 * <pre>`
 * try (ThreadLocalReason.Closable __ = ThreadLocalReason.closable("Hello World")) {
 * guild.ban(user, 0).queue(v -> {
 * guild.unban(user).queue(); // also uses the reason "Hello World"
 * });
 * } // automatically changes reason back
 * //This will not use the reason "Hello World" but the previous, or none if none was set previously
