/**
 * Indicates that a {@link Guild} finished setting up
 * <br>This event is fired if a guild finished setting up during login phase.
 * After this event is fired, JDA will start dispatching events related to this guild.
 * This indicates a guild was created and added to the cache. It will be fired for both the initial
 * setup and full reconnects (indicated by {@link SessionRecreateEvent}).
 *
 * <p>Can be used to initialize any services that depend on this guild.
 *
 * <p>When a guild fails to ready up due to Discord outages you will not receive this event.
 * Guilds that fail to ready up will either timeout or get marked as unavailable.
 * <br>You can use {@link ReadyEvent#getGuildUnavailableCount()} and {@link JDA#getUnavailableGuilds()} to check for unavailable guilds.
 * {@link GuildTimeoutEvent} will be fired for guilds that don't ready up and also don't get marked as unavailable by Discord.
 * Guilds that timeout will be marked as unavailable by the timeout event,
 * they will <b>not</b> fire a {@link GuildUnavailableEvent} as that event is only indicating that a guild becomes unavailable <b>after</b> ready happened.
