/**
 * Indicates that the activities of a guild member changed.
 *
 * <p>This is fired after a sequence of {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.user.UserActivityStartEvent UserActivityStartEvents} and {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.user.UserActivityEndEvent UserActivityEndEvents}
 * are fired and can be used to handle the resulting list of activities for the member.
 *
 * <p>Identifier: {@code activities}
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>This event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_PRESENCES GUILD_PRESENCES} intent to be enabled.
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createDefault(String) createDefault(String)} and
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disable this by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
 *
 * <p>This also requires {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag#ACTIVITY CacheFlag.ACTIVITY} to be enabled.
 * You can enable the cache flag with {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#enableCache(CacheFlag, CacheFlag...) enableCache(CacheFlag.ACTIVITY)}.

 * @since  4.2.1
