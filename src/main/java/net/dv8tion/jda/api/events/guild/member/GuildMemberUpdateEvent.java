/**
 * Fired for every {@link Member} update, regardless of cache.
 *
 * <p>This is a watered-down version of the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.guild.member.update.GenericGuildMemberUpdateEvent GenericGuildMemberUpdateEvent}
 * which only provides the updated member instance. This is useful when JDA cannot fire specific update events when the member is uncached.
 *
 * <p>You can use this to do stateless checks on member instances to update database entries or check for special roles.
 * Note that the member might not be in cache when this event is fired due to the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}.
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>This event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_MEMBERS GUILD_MEMBERS} intent to be enabled.
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createDefault(String) createDefault(String)} and
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disable this by default!
