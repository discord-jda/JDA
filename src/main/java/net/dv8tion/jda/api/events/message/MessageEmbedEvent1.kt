/**
 * Indicates that a Message contains an [Embed][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.MessageEmbed] in a [MessageChannel][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.channel.middleman.MessageChannel].
 * <br></br>Discord may need to do additional calculations and resizing tasks on messages that embed websites, thus they send the message only with content and link and use this update to add the missing embed later when the server finishes those calculations.
 *
 *
 * Can be used to retrieve MessageEmbeds from any message. No matter if private or guild.
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * This event requires at least one of the following intents (Will not fire at all if neither is enabled):
 *
 *  * [GUILD_MESSAGES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_MESSAGES] to work in guild text channels
 *  * [DIRECT_MESSAGES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.DIRECT_MESSAGES] to work in private channels
