/**
 * Indicates that a [Guild] finished setting up
 * <br></br>This event is fired if a guild finished setting up during login phase.
 * After this event is fired, JDA will start dispatching events related to this guild.
 * This indicates a guild was created and added to the cache. It will be fired for both the initial
 * setup and full reconnects (indicated by [SessionRecreateEvent]).
 *
 *
 * Can be used to initialize any services that depend on this guild.
 *
 *
 * When a guild fails to ready up due to Discord outages you will not receive this event.
 * Guilds that fail to ready up will either timeout or get marked as unavailable.
 * <br></br>You can use [ReadyEvent.getGuildUnavailableCount] and [JDA.getUnavailableGuilds] to check for unavailable guilds.
 * [GuildTimeoutEvent] will be fired for guilds that don't ready up and also don't get marked as unavailable by Discord.
 * Guilds that timeout will be marked as unavailable by the timeout event,
 * they will **not** fire a [GuildUnavailableEvent] as that event is only indicating that a guild becomes unavailable **after** ready happened.
