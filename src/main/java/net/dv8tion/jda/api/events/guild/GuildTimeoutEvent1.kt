/**
 * Indicates that a guild failed to ready up and timed out.
 * <br></br>Usually this event will be fired right before a [ReadyEvent].
 *
 *
 * This will mark the guild as **unavailable** and it will not be usable when JDA becomes ready.
 * You can check all unavailable guilds with [ReadyEvent.getGuildUnavailableCount] and [JDA.getUnavailableGuilds].
 *
 *
 * **Developer Note**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * Discord may also explicitly mark guilds as unavailable during the setup, in which case this event will not fire.
 * It is recommended to check for unavailable guilds in the ready event explicitly to avoid any ambiguity.
