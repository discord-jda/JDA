/**
 * Indicates that a gateway event relating to a [ScheduledEvent] has been fired.
 *
 *
 *  It should be noted that a [ScheduledEvent] is not an
 * actual gateway event found in the [net.dv8tion.jda.api.events] package, but are rather entities similar to
 * [User][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.User] or [TextChannel][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.channel.concrete.TextChannel] objects
 * representing a [scheduled event](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409494125719-Scheduled-Events).
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * These events require the [SCHEDULED_EVENTS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.SCHEDULED_EVENTS] intent and [CacheFlag.SCHEDULED_EVENTS] to be enabled.
 * <br></br>[createDefault(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createDefault] and
 * [createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disable this by default!
 *
 *
 * This class may be used to check if a gateway event is related to a [ScheduledEvent]
 * as all gateway events in the [net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.guild.scheduledevent] package extend this class.
