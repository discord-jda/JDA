/**
 * Indicates that the activities of a guild member changed.
 *
 *
 * This is fired after a sequence of [UserActivityStartEvents][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.user.UserActivityStartEvent] and [UserActivityEndEvents][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.user.UserActivityEndEvent]
 * are fired and can be used to handle the resulting list of activities for the member.
 *
 *
 * Identifier: `activities`
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * This event requires the [GUILD_PRESENCES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_PRESENCES] intent to be enabled.
 * <br></br>[createDefault(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createDefault] and
 * [createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disable this by default!
 *
 *
 * Additionally, this event requires the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy]
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
 *
 *
 * This also requires [CacheFlag.ACTIVITY][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag.ACTIVITY] to be enabled.
 * You can enable the cache flag with [enableCache(CacheFlag.ACTIVITY)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.enableCache].
 *
 * @since  4.2.1
