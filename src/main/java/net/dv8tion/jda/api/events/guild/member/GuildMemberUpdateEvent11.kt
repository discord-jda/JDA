/**
 * Fired for every [Member] update, regardless of cache.
 *
 *
 * This is a watered-down version of the [GenericGuildMemberUpdateEvent][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.guild.member.update.GenericGuildMemberUpdateEvent]
 * which only provides the updated member instance. This is useful when JDA cannot fire specific update events when the member is uncached.
 *
 *
 * You can use this to do stateless checks on member instances to update database entries or check for special roles.
 * Note that the member might not be in cache when this event is fired due to the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy].
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * This event requires the [GUILD_MEMBERS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS] intent to be enabled.
 * <br></br>[createDefault(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createDefault] and
 * [createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disable this by default!
 *
 * @since  4.2.1
