/**
 * Indicates that a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member Member} disconnected from a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.AudioChannel AudioChannel}.
 *
 * <p><b>When the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member Member} is moved a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.guild.voice.GuildVoiceMoveEvent GuildVoiceMoveEvent} is fired instead</b>
 *
 * <p>Can be used to detect when a member leaves a voice channel completely.
 *
 * <h2>Requirements</h2>
 *
 * <p>This event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag#VOICE_STATE VOICE_STATE} CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_VOICE_STATES GUILD_VOICE_STATES} intent.
 *
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disables that CacheFlag by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
