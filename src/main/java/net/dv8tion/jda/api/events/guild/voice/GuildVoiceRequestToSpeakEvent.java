/**
 * Indicates that a guild member has updated their {@link GuildVoiceState#getRequestToSpeakTimestamp() Request-to-Speak}.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #getNewTime()} is non-null, this means the member has <em>raised their hand</em> and wants to speak.
 * You can use {@link #approveSpeaker()} or {@link #declineSpeaker()} to handle this request if you have {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.Permission#VOICE_MUTE_OTHERS Permission.VOICE_MUTE_OTHERS}.
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>These events require the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag#VOICE_STATE VOICE_STATE} CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_VOICE_STATES GUILD_VOICE_STATES} intent.
 *
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disables that CacheFlag by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, these events require the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire specific events like these we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
