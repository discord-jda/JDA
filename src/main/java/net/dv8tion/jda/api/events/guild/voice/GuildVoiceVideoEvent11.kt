/**
 * Indicates that a [Member][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member] turned on their camera.
 *
 *
 * Can be used to detect when a user starts/stops sending video.
 * <br></br>This does not include streams! Use [GuildVoiceStreamEvent][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.guild.voice.GuildVoiceStreamEvent] for that!
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * This event requires the [VOICE_STATE][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag.VOICE_STATE] CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the [GUILD_VOICE_STATES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_VOICE_STATES] intent.
 *
 * <br></br>[createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disables that CacheFlag by default!
 *
 *
 * Additionally, this event requires the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy]
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
