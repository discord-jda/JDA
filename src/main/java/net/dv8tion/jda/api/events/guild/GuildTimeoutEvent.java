/**
 * Indicates that a guild failed to ready up and timed out.
 * <br>Usually this event will be fired right before a {@link ReadyEvent ReadyEvent}.
 *
 * <p>This will mark the guild as <b>unavailable</b> and it will not be usable when JDA becomes ready.
 * You can check all unavailable guilds with {@link ReadyEvent#getGuildUnavailableCount()} and {@link JDA#getUnavailableGuilds()}.
 *
 * <p><b>Developer Note</b><br>
 *
 * <p>Discord may also explicitly mark guilds as unavailable during the setup, in which case this event will not fire.
 * It is recommended to check for unavailable guilds in the ready event explicitly to avoid any ambiguity.
