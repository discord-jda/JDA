/**
 * Indicates that a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.User User} has started an {@link Activity}
 * in a {@link Guild}.
 *
 * <p>This is fired for every {@link Guild} the user is part of. If the title of a stream
 * changes a start event is fired before an end event which will replace the activity.
 *
 * <p>The activities of the {@link Member} are updated before all the start/end events are fired.
 * This means you can check {@link Member#getActivities()} when handling this event and it will already
 * contain all new activities, even ones that have not yet fired the start event.
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>This event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_PRESENCES GUILD_PRESENCES} intent to be enabled.
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createDefault(String) createDefault(String)} and
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disable this by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
 *
 * <p>This also requires {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag#ACTIVITY CacheFlag.ACTIVITY} to be enabled.
 * You can enable the cache flag with {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#enableCache(CacheFlag, CacheFlag...) enableCache(CacheFlag.ACTIVITY)}.
