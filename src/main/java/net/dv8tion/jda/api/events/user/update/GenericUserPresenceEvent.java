/**
 * Indicates that the presence of a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.User User} has changed.
 * <br>Users don't have presences directly, this is fired when a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member Member} from a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild Guild}
 * changes their presence.
 *
 * <p>Can be used to track the presence updates of members.
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>These events require the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_PRESENCES GUILD_PRESENCES} intent to be enabled.
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createDefault(String) createDefault(String)} and
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disable this by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, these events require the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
