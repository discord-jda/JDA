 * This event requires the [GUILD_MEMBERS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS] intent to be enabled.
 * <br></br>[createDefault(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createDefault] and
 * [createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disable this by default!

 *
 * Additionally, this event requires the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy]
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
