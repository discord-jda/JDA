/**
 * Indicates that a [Member][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member] joined or left an [AudioChannel].
 *
 * Can be used to detect when a Member leaves/joins an AudioChannel.
 *
 *
 * **Example**<br></br>
 * <pre>`AudioChannelUnion joinedChannel = event.getChannelJoined();
 * AudioChannelUnion leftChannel = event.getChannelLeft();
 *
 * if (joinedChannel != null) {
 * // the member joined an audio channel
 * }
 * if (leftChannel != null) {
 * // the member left an audio channel
 * }
 * if (joinedChannel != null && leftChannel != null) {
 * // the member moved between two audio channels in the same guild
 * }
`</pre> *
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * This event requires the [VOICE_STATE][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag.VOICE_STATE] CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the [GUILD_VOICE_STATES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_VOICE_STATES] intent.
 *
 * <br></br>[createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disables that CacheFlag by default!
 *
 *
 * Additionally, this event requires the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy]
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
 *
 *
 * Identifier: `audio-channel`
