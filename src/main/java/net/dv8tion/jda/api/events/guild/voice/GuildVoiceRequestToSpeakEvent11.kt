/**
 * Indicates that a guild member has updated their [Request-to-Speak][GuildVoiceState.getRequestToSpeakTimestamp].
 *
 *
 * If [.getNewTime] is non-null, this means the member has *raised their hand* and wants to speak.
 * You can use [.approveSpeaker] or [.declineSpeaker] to handle this request if you have [Permission.VOICE_MUTE_OTHERS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.Permission.VOICE_MUTE_OTHERS].
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * These events require the [VOICE_STATE][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag.VOICE_STATE] CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the [GUILD_VOICE_STATES][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_VOICE_STATES] intent.
 *
 * <br></br>[createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disables that CacheFlag by default!
 *
 *
 * Additionally, these events require the [MemberCachePolicy][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy]
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire specific events like these we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
