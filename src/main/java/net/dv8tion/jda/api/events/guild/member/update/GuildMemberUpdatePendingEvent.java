 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b><br>
 *
 * <p>This event requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent#GUILD_MEMBERS GUILD_MEMBERS} intent to be enabled.
 * <br>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createDefault(String) createDefault(String)} and
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder#createLight(String) createLight(String)} disable this by default!
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this event also requires the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.MemberCachePolicy MemberCachePolicy}
 * to cache the updated members. Discord does not specifically tell us about the updates, but merely tells us the
 * member was updated and gives us the updated member object. In order to fire a specific event like this we
 * need to have the old member cached to compare against.
 *
 * @incubating Discord is still trying to figure this out
 *
 * @since  4.2.1
