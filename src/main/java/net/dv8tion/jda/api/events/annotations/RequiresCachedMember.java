/**
 * Annotates this event as requiring a cached member to fire,
 * or a method requiring a cached member to return appropriate results.
 *
 * <p>For a member/user to be cached, {@link GatewayIntent#GUILD_MEMBERS GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS} needs to be enabled,
 * and the {@link MemberCachePolicy} configured to allow some, if not all, members to be cached.
 * <br>Assuming the cache policy allows a member to be cached, the member will be loaded in the cache when either:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>JDA loads it on startup, if a {@link ChunkingFilter} is configured</li>
 *     <li>It is loaded explicitly, for example, using {@link Guild#retrieveMemberById(long)}</li>
 *     <li>An event containing a member is received, such as {@link SlashCommandInteractionEvent}</li>
 * </ul>
