/**
 * Interactions which allow message replies in the channel they were used in.
 *
 *
 * These replies automatically acknowledge the interaction and support deferring.
 *
 *
 * **Deferred Replies**<br></br>
 *
 * If an interaction reply is deferred using [.deferReply] or [.deferReply],
 * the [interaction hook][.getHook] can be used to send a delayed/deferred reply with [InteractionHook.sendMessage].
 * When using [.deferReply] the first message sent to the [InteractionHook] will be identical to using [InteractionHook.editOriginal].
 * You must decide whether your reply will be ephemeral or not before calling [.deferReply]. So design your code flow with that in mind!
 *
 *
 * If a reply is [deferred][.deferReply], it becomes the **original** message of the interaction hook.
 * This means all the methods with `original` in the name, such as [InteractionHook.editOriginal],
 * will affect that original reply.
