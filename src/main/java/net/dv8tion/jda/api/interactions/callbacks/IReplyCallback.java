/**
 * Interactions which allow message replies in the channel they were used in.
 *
 * <p>These replies automatically acknowledge the interaction and support deferring.
 *
 * <p><b>Deferred Replies</b><br>
 *
 * If an interaction reply is deferred using {@link #deferReply()} or {@link #deferReply(boolean)},
 * the {@link #getHook() interaction hook} can be used to send a delayed/deferred reply with {@link InteractionHook#sendMessage(String)}.
 * When using {@link #deferReply()} the first message sent to the {@link InteractionHook} will be identical to using {@link InteractionHook#editOriginal(String)}.
 * You must decide whether your reply will be ephemeral or not before calling {@link #deferReply()}. So design your code flow with that in mind!
 *
 * <p>If a reply is {@link #deferReply() deferred}, it becomes the <b>original</b> message of the interaction hook.
 * This means all the methods with {@code original} in the name, such as {@link InteractionHook#editOriginal(String)},
 * will affect that original reply.
