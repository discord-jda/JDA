/**
 * Functional interface accepting a localization key (complete path used to get the appropriate translations)
 * and returning a map of discord locales to their localized strings
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation note:</b>
 * The localization key is composed of the command/option/choice tree being walked with each component being separated by a dot
 * <br>Note: the final key is lowercase and spaces replaced by underscores
 * <br>A few examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>The name of a command named "ban": {@code ban.name}</li>
 *    <li>The name of a message context named "Get content raw": {@code get_content_raw.name}</li>
 *    <li>The description of a command named "ban": {@code ban.description}</li>
 *    <li>The name of a subcommand "perm" in a command named "ban": {@code ban.perm.name}</li>
 *    <li>The description of an option "duration" in a subcommand "perm" in a command named "ban": {@code ban.perm.duration.description}</li>
 *    <li>The name of a choice in an option "duration" in a subcommand "perm" in a command named "ban": {@code ban.perm.duration.choice.name}</li>
 * </ul>
