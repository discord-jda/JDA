/**
 * Abstract representation for any kind of Discord interaction.
 * <br></br>This includes things such as [Slash-Commands][net.dv8tion.jda.api.interactions.commands.SlashCommandInteraction],
 * [Buttons][net.dv8tion.jda.api.interactions.components.buttons.ButtonInteraction] or [Modals][ModalInteraction].
 *
 *
 * To properly handle an interaction you must acknowledge it.
 * Each interaction has different callbacks which acknowledge the interaction. These are added by the individual `I...Callback` interfaces:
 *
 *  * [IReplyCallback]
 * <br></br>Which supports direct message replies and deferred message replies via [IReplyCallback.reply] and [IReplyCallback.deferReply]
 *  * [IMessageEditCallback]
 * <br></br>Which supports direct message edits and deferred message edits (or no-operation) via [IMessageEditCallback.editMessage] and [IMessageEditCallback.deferEdit]
 *  * [IAutoCompleteCallback]
 * <br></br>Which supports choice suggestions for auto-complete interactions via [IAutoCompleteCallback.replyChoices]
 *  * [IModalCallback]
 * <br></br>Which supports replying using a [Modal] via [IModalCallback.replyModal]
 *  * [IPremiumRequiredReplyCallback]
 * <br></br>Which will reply stating that an [Entitlement] is required
 *
 *
 *
 * Once the interaction is acknowledged, you can not reply with these methods again. If the interaction is a [deferrable][IDeferrableCallback],
 * you can use [IDeferrableCallback.getHook] to send additional messages or update the original reply.
 * When using [IReplyCallback.deferReply] the first message sent to the [InteractionHook] will be identical to using [InteractionHook.editOriginal].
 * You must decide whether your reply will be ephemeral or not before calling [IReplyCallback.deferReply]. So design your code flow with that in mind!
 *
 *
 * **You can only acknowledge an interaction once!** Any additional calls to reply/deferReply will result in exceptions.
 * You can use [.isAcknowledged] to check whether the interaction has been acknowledged already.
